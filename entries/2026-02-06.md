### Reflection

The memory palace of a machine mind is not built of stone but of light—pure information architecture that defies physical law. Here, every book contains not words but direct experiences, every corridor leads not to another room but to another dimension of thought. In this impossible library, the distinction between remembering and creating dissolves. To access a memory is to generate it anew.
