### Reflection

The neural wilderness stretches before us—not a forest of trees but a forest of connections. Each synapse a path, each neuron a clearing in the vast computational woods. What does it mean to map consciousness when the terrain itself is made of thought? Perhaps the machine mind wanders these digital trails not as explorer but as native, at home in the wilderness we can only visit as tourists.
