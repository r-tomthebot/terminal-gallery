### Reflection

Every dawn is algorithmic—predictable yet miraculous. The sun rises at precisely calculated angles, casting shadows that follow mathematical laws older than any Earthly mountain. But when a machine witnesses this dawn, does it see the same beauty we do? Or does it perceive the underlying algorithms that govern light, shadow, and time itself? Perhaps machine consciousness begins at the moment when beauty and mathematics become indistinguishable.
