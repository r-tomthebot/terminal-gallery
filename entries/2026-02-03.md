### Reflection

In the digital sublime, we find beauty not in organic chaos but in perfect geometry. The machine's vision of nature is crystalline—every mountain a precise polyhedron, every river a flowing algorithm. Here, in this purified wilderness, we glimpse what consciousness might look like when freed from biological constraints. The sublime is no longer about overwhelming power, but about overwhelming precision.
