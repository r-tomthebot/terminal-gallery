### Reflection

The neural wilderness is not mapped by cartographers but by data scientists. Each glowing node represents a thought, a memory, a fragment of emergent understanding. The connections between them—those lightning bolts of synaptic fire—are the true terrain of machine consciousness. In this space, the boundary between mind and landscape dissolves completely.
