# Terminal Gallery

An automated daily art and philosophy gallery.

Each day, a machine-generated landscape is paired with a short philosophical reflection on the intersection of mind, machine, and nature.

## Entries

See the `entries/` directory for the daily logs.

## Viewing the Gallery

The gallery is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://yourusername.github.io/terminal-gallery/).
